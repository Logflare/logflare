# Datadog

The Datadog backend is **ingest-only**, and sends events to the Datadog HTTP API.

See the Datadog HTTP API [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/#send-logs) for details on how the API handles events.

## Behaviour and configurations

### Configuration

The following values are required when creating a webhook backend:

- `api_key`: (`string`, required) a API Key generated from the Datadog dashboard, specific for that region.
- `region`: (`string`, required) specific region API to send the events to. Corresponds to the [Datadog sites](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/) (for example `US5`)

### Implementation Details

Implementation is based on the [webhook backend](/backends/webhook).

Events will be gzipped and batch with a maximum of 250 events per request. The source name will be set as the service name.
