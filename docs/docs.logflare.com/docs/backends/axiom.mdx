# Axiom

The Axiom backend is **ingest-only**, and sends the logs to Axiom.co via their [HTTP API](https://axiom.co/docs/restapi/ingest)


## Behaviour and configurations

### Configuration

The backend can be configured with following options:

- `:api_token` (string, required) - An API token for ingestion, can be generated in `Settings->API Tokens`
- `:dataset_name` (string, required) - Name of the dataset used for log ingest.
  The dataset must be created in Axiom before starting the ingestion from Logflare.
- `:domain` (string) - The domain specific to the region your account is using,
    Defaults to the US domain (`api.axiom.co`)

### Implementation Details

The timestamp of each log event is transformed into format recognized by Axiom.
