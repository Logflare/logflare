# Loki

The Loki backend is **ingest-only**, and sends events to a Loki HTTP API.

See the Loki HTTP API [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/reference/loki-http-api/#ingest-logs) for details on how the API handles events.

## Behaviour and configurations

### Configuration

The following values are required when creating a webhook backend:

- `url`: (`string`, required) the HTTP url to send the events to.
- `headers`: (`map`, optional) the headers to be attached to the HTTP request, for authentication purposes.

### Implementation Details

Implementation is based on the [webhook backend](/backends/webhook).

Events will be gzipped as a JSON payload, and will be batched with a maximum of 250 events per request.

The source name will be used as the stream label.
