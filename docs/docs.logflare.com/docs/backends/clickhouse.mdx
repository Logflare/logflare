# ClickHouse

The ClickHouse backend is **ingest-only** to a ClickHouse [HTTP](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/http) endpoint.

## Behavior and Configuration

### Configuration

The following values are required when creating a ClickHouse backend:

- `url`: (`string`, required) a valid HTTP(S) endpoint.
- `username`: (`string`, required) used for auth.
- `password`: (`string`, required) used for auth.
- `database`: (`string`, required) the database to use.
- `port`: (`number`, required) the port to use.


### User Grants

The ClickHouse backend requires the following [user grants](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/statements/grant):

- `INSERT`
- `SELECT`
- `CREATE TABLE`
- `ALTER TABLE`
- `DROP TABLE`,
- `CREATE VIEW`
- `DROP VIEW`

:::note
It is suggested that you create a dedicated database and user specifically for Logflare to isolate data and permissions.

## Implementation Details

The ClickHouse backend will automatically attempt to provision required tables and views after receiving the first log event.

The ingest table schema is as follows:

- `id`: The log event `UUID`.
- `event_message`: The provided or generated event message of the log event, stored as `String`
- `body`: The processed log event, stored as serialized JSON in a `String` column.
- `timestamp`: Unix microsecond, stored as `DateTime64(6)`
