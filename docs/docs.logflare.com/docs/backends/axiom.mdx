# Axiom

The Axiom backend is **ingest-only**, and sends the logs to Axiom.co via REST API

It has support for connection testing.

## Behaviour and configurations

### Configuration

The backend can be configured with following options:

- `:api_token` (string, required) - An API token for ingestion, can be generated in `Settings->API Tokens`
- `:dataset_name` (string, required) - Name of the dataset used for log ingest.
  The dataset must be created in Axiom before starting the ingestion from Logflare.
- `:domain` (string) - The domain specific to the region your account is using,
    Defaults to the US domain (`api.axiom.co`)

### Implementation Details

Implementation is based on the [webhook backend](/backends/webhook).

The timestamp of each log event is transformed into format recognized by axiom,
otherwise the log events are forwarded without modifications.
