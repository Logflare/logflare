# Querying

Logflare provides a filtering UI to expressively query for log events. Currently, the [Logflare Query Language](#logflare-query-language-lql) is supported.

<img
  alt="Search UI"
  src={require("./search-ui.png").default}
  style={{ maxHeight: 800, maxWidth: "100%" }}
/>

## Live Search

When searching logs, you can turn your current search into a **Live Search**, which tails the source and streams new events that match the filter into the search results.

## Query Saving

Queries that are frequently used can be saved, and will be available for quick access from the dashboard.

## Querying Outside of Logflare

Certain backends provide querying functionality. Documentation on each can be found in specific backend guide.
