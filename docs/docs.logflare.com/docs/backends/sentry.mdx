# Sentry

The Sentry backend is **ingest-only**, and sends log events to Sentry's [Logs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/logs/) product.

## Behaviour and configurations

### Configuration

The following value is required when creating a Sentry backend:

- `dsn`: (`string`, required) a DSN (Data Source Name) string from your Sentry project. You can find your project's DSN in the Sentry dashboard under: **Settings** → **Projects** → **[Your Project]** → **Client Keys (DSN)**

#### Example DSN

```
https://abc123@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/123456
```

### Implementation Details

Implementation is based on the [webhook backend](/backends/webhook).

Log events are transformed into Sentry's envelope format with the following behavior:

- Log levels are normalized to Sentry's expected levels (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`)
- All log event metadata is flattened and included as Sentry log attributes
- The source name and ID are included in the log attributes
