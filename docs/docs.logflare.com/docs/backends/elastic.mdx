# Elastic

The Elastic backend is **ingest-only** to a Filebeat HTTP server endpoint.

## Behaviour and configurations
### Configuration

The following values are required when creating a webhook backend:

- `url`: (`string`, required) a valid HTTP(S) endpoint.
- `username`: (`string`, optional) used for basic auth.
- `password`: (`string`, optional) used for basic auth.

### Implementation Details

Implementation is based on the [webhook backend](../webhook).
