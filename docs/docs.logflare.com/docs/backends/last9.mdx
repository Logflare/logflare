# Last9.io

The Last9.io backend is **ingest-only**, and sends logs to [Last9](https://last9.io) via OTLP/HTTP.

## Behaviour and configurations

### Configuration

The backend can be configured with the following options:

- `:region` (string, required) - The region for the endpoint. Can be either `US-WEST-1` or `AP-SOUTH-1`.
- `:username` (string, required) - The username for authentication.
- `:password` (string, required) - The password for authentication.

You can obtain the username and password from the [Last9 OTel integration panel](https://app.last9.io/integrations?integration=OpenTelemetry).

### Implementation Details

- The adaptor sends logs to a region-specific endpoint (e.g., `https://otlp.last9.io/v1/logs`).
- It uses OTLP over HTTP with Protobuf encoding.
- Authentication is handled via HTTP Basic Auth using the provided `:username` and `:password`.
